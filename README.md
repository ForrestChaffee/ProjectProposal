# ProjectProposal
**Summary:** I have resources that can give me information on wave height and direction, wind speed and direction, current speed and direction, and water temperature and salinity. While these can go in all directions I will speak in terms of average directions. In all of Californias coast the wind direction averages towards the northwest and the wave direction averages towards the west. In terms of direction, Northern Californias currents average towards the North, Central Californias Currents Average towards the NorthWest, and Southern Californias currents Average towards the East. These contrasts in measurement outcomes between regions must have an underlying cause.

**Motivation:** Oceanography is studied in detail. It is an integral part of ecosystems as it transports nutrients. It is an integral part of our climate partaking in the absorption and distribution of heat. Keeping track of it can help us assure everyones well being in the face of certain weather crises. The Oceans makeup is determined by numerous inside and outside forces. This includes Ocean surface topography which is read from satelites and currents which are tracked by buoys. Currents can be caused by wind, thermohaline circulation or the tendency of warm water near the equator to increase in latitude and ascend then become denser as it cools and thereby sink and return to the equator and, a coriolis effect or clockwise loop of earths currents cause from the rotation of the earth. Whether or not any of this is to be revealed in the upcoming project is yet to be seen.

**Results:** 
I would start by using numpy and matplotlib to create a map of a vector field representing currents based using what is found of incoming currents, topography and, the forces of wind. I would compare this to what has been recorded.

**Questions:** What is responsible for the difference in average currents in Southern California compared to Californias other regions?
